## Notes and Considerations

- Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Regular code reviews should be conducted
- Documentation should be maintained alongside development
- Security considerations should be integrated into each phase
- Regular testing against the MongoDB adapter should be performed to ensure compatibility
- AWS best practices should be followed for DynamoDB usage
- Payload CMS patterns and conventions should be maintained
- Error handling and logging should be consistent with Payload CMS standards
- Testing should include both local DynamoDB and AWS DynamoDB environments
- Cost optimization should be considered in all phases
- Performance monitoring should be implemented throughout
- Transaction support should be carefully designed for each operation
- Client-side processing should be used where DynamoDB limitations exist

## Key Findings and Challenges

- The MongoDB adapter has a more granular file structure with individual files for each operation
- Missing several core files that exist in the MongoDB adapter
- Need to restructure the source directory to better match MongoDB adapter's organization
- Version-related operations are currently missing and need to be implemented
- Migration support needs to be added to match MongoDB adapter's capabilities
- Need to add proper transaction support with dedicated directory
- Query support needs to be moved to a dedicated queries/ directory
