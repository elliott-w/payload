- Testing should include both local DynamoDB and AWS DynamoDB environments
- Cost optimization should be considered in all phases
- Performance monitoring should be implemented throughout
- Transaction support should be carefully designed for each operation
- Client-side processing should be used where DynamoDB limitations exist
