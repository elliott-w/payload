# Payload CMS DynamoDB Adapter Project

## Project Goal

Create a DynamoDB adapter for Payload CMS that implements the BaseDatabaseAdapter interface in @types.ts

## Method

- Execute the tasks in [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](mdc:packages/db-dynamo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) step by step until they are all completed.
- You are always allowed to mark/unmark tasks in the [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](mdc:packages/db-dynamo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) as completed.
- You can edit the steps in the [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](mdc:packages/db-dynamo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) as you discover more information and the path to your goal becomes more clear. You should only edit the steps in the [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](mdc:packages/db-dynamo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) when you think you have encountered a significant challenge or new information that requires changing course. Basically only edit the plan if you think it's quite important.
- You can also edit the "Key Findings" at the bottom of the [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](mdc:packages/db-dynamo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). You should only do this when you encounter an error or bug or new piece of information that has a significant impact on how you approach the project goal.

## Project Structure

This project follows a monorepo structure with the following key directories:

- `packages/db-dynamo`: The main package directory for the DynamoDB adapter
  - All new files and directories MUST be created within this directory
  - This includes documentation, research plans, and any other project-related files
  - The only exception is if explicitly instructed otherwise

- `packages/db-mongodb`: Reference implementation for MongoDB adapter
  - Use this as a reference for implementing the DynamoDB adapter
  - Study its structure and patterns

- `packages/payload`: Core Payload CMS package
  - Reference for understanding required functionality

## Important Notes

- All new files and directories MUST be created within `packages/db-dynamo`
- Follow the existing patterns from the MongoDB adapter while adapting them for DynamoDB's specific requirements
- The MongoDB adapter serves as a reference but should not be copied directly
- Pay special attention to DynamoDB's specific requirements and limitations
- Ensure all implementations follow Payload CMS's patterns and conventions
